			<h3>CPU</h3>
				<p>The <strong>CPU</strong>, or <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong>, is the heart of a computer. 
				This is where all of the bits of information get manipulated. Two major companies who manufature CPUs are Intel and AMD.</p>
			
			<h3>Motherboard</h3>
				<p>The <strong>motherboard</strong> is where every component of the computer comes together. 
				Each piece connects to the motherboard so that they can interact with each other.</p>
			
			<h3>RAM</h3>
				<p>The <strong>RAM</strong> is the short-term memory of the computer. 
				Data is temporarily stored there so that it can be quickly accessed. But once the computer is turned off, <em>the memory on the Ram is wiped</em></p>
			
			<h3>Powersupply</h3>
				<p>The <strong>Powersupply</strong> is very self explanatory. This unit sends power to every piece in the computer.</p>
			
			<h3>Hard Drive</h3>
				<p>The <strong>Hard Drive</strong> is the long-term memory of the computer. Data is permenately stored here, 
				but accessing it is much slower than accessing data from the RAM</p>
			
			<h3>GPU</h3>
				<p>The <strong>GPU</strong>, or <strong>Graphical Processing Unit</strong>, is an extra piece to help the CPU. 
				This part is dedicated to help process the graphical images seen on a <strong>monitor</strong>.</p>
			
			<h3>Fans</h3>
				<p><strong>Fans</strong> help to keep the parts of the computer cool. 
				There is always a dedicated fan for the CPU and the GPU that is attached with a <strong>heat spreader</strong>.</p>
			
			<h3>Case</h3>
				<p>The <strong>case</strong> is the unit you store all of the parts in.</p>
			
			<h3>Operating System</h3>
				<p>The <strong>operating system</strong> is the program you use to run all of the parts together. 
				The two main operating systems are Windows and OSX</p><br/>
